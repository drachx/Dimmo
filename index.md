You can also multi spec Surv(32) then Glad(38) lastly Vang(31) - I prio life stats

My Starter Legendary Gems
=========================
1. **Fervant Fang (Free BP40) - does fantastic single target damage. It can easily be acquired from the Battle Pass, without relying on luck from crests.
2. **Lightning Core - (AOE) does direct damage to an enemy group, often wiping them out in the process. While the damage is infrequent, it's useful for taking down larger targets.
3. **Power and Command - (dmg, anti cc) Alternates states every nine seconds. Power state increases your primary attack damage by 8%. Command state increases all other skill damage by 8%
4. *Trickshot Gem - (less energy) allows you to channel Whirlwind longer, especially when ranked up and awakened! The best 1 star Legendary Gem Whirlwind Barb!
5. *Everlasting Torment - (20s cd, 6s dmg) deals incredible damage over time after a Critical Hit. For a simple 1 star Legendary Gem, this packs a punch.
6. *Chained Death - (stacks 3x) gives a solid damage boost, especially in AoE situations.


Best Legendary Gems
===================
1. **Blood-Soaked Jade - is the best Legendary Gem in the game. It provides massive damage and movement speed, which is perfect for our Spin to Win Barbarian.
2. **Seeping Bile - has poison that is devastating in large densities, like Elder and Challenge Rifts. When shredding through enemies with Whirlwind, you'll get so many hits in quick succession that this Gem procs all over the place!
3. **Blessing of the Worthy - is amazing because you're constantly in melee range of enemies. Any damage taken activates devastating damage every 15 seconds, obliterating anything nearby.
4. **Phoenix Ashes - gives a cheat death that increases in effectiveness as you rank this gem up. There might be unpredictable interactions between this Gem and Undying Rage, so we have to see how it performs with more testing.
5. **Bottled Hope - provides great damage and movement speed. It can be triggered easily by using Sprint, Wrath of the Berserker or Undying Rage.
6. **Chip of Stone Flesh - increases your damage sigificantly and can proc from any hard cc like your stun from the Hammer of the Ancients + combination. In this PvP Guide however it is mostly a stat & resonance boost.

Battlegrounds
=============
Mechanics is actually very simple
1. Attacker 
- Stage 1: Kill the 3 idols. All must kill mid idol First. And then split up side idols. As the barbarian, try to WW the idol and if you see any incoming reds and you have enough DPS on idol, move to front and lure the enemy away from objectives.
- Stage 2: When you see the stage 1 idol is like less than 30% and you feel like it will be down in secs, rush to wake up 2 idols. Once this is awake, you will have to stay in front of the idols. Let Necro and Wiz push it. Don't be afraid to die you have Gladiator and Unstable Rage skills.
- Stage 3: Easy. Make sure you have 1 charge and sprint off CD. Go to the heart. Whirlwind till you are 30%, charge out and sprint to heal. Repeat!

2. Defender
- Stage 1: Sprint early once the gate opened. Double charge between the reds and whirlwind CC them. Quickly sprint and charge out hope that you lure the monk or DH to you.
- Stage 2: Charge in and WW. Do not let the reds wake the idols. If they are pushing, just charge in WW and charge out. Sprint away to heal. Lure them out of the idols.
- Stage 3: There is nothing you can do here unless you guys are like 45/55 kills. If the reds reach Stage 3, they are really good in pushing. So just charge, ww, charge out strat. Get a kill and get more assists.
